curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health

# Applications
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/applications/

# AI Services
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/ai/health

# Job Search (needs fixing)
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/jobs/search?query=engineer
```

### **Frontend Testing**
```bash
# Development server
curl http://localhost:5173

# Component testing
npm test

# Build testing
npm run build
```
